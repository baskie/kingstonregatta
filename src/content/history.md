Kingston Regatta - 1911</div>
      <p>Kingston Regatta was first raced on 1st and 2nd of June 1857 after entries
        were invited in the &lsquo;Surrey Comet&rsquo; and &lsquo;Richmond, Kingston
        and Epsom Gazette&rsquo;. The entry fee was a staggering 10 shillings
        for a junior (equivalent to &pound;40 today!) and a senior was around
        double that amount. 77 competitors competed in 21 races in the pouring
        rain and afterwards the Chairman, Colonel Challoner, proposed a toast
        to the &lsquo;Success of the Kingston Regatta&rsquo;. From such modest
        beginnings the Regatta was born and would go on to be one of the main
        events of the rowing calendar. It has had its highs and lows going through
        2 world wars but we are pleased to say that in this 150th Anniversary
        Year the Regatta is on a high with over 1,200 expected to compete in
        nearly 400 races in front of 4,000 spectators. In the first 80 years,
        the Regatta was run from its spiritual home at Kingston Rowing Club whose
        boathouse was on Raven&rsquo;s Ait - see image from 1911 with the well
        kept lawn and band. (The photo on the home page is of Kingston
        RC, winners of the Senior 4s.) The Regatta was a major event in both
        the sporting and social calendar and would have regular reports in the
        national and sports press.</p>

      <p>However, Kingston RC did not always have its own way as Thames RC demonstrated
        (looking towards Raven&rsquo;s Ait from the end of Queen&rsquo;s Promenade)
        by beating Kingston in the final of the same event in 1919. At bow of
        the Thames crew was a young Jack Beresford, the son of Polish immigrants
        who&rsquo;s full name was Jack Beresford Wiszniewski. Beresford rivals
        Steve Redgrave in competing at 5 consecutive Olympics from 1920 to 1936
        winning 3 Golds and 2 Silvers. In his first Olympiad in 1920 he lost
        in the final of the single sculls to American Jack Kelly (Father of actress
        Grace Kelly who later became Princess Grace of Monaco) by 1 second, still
        the tightest margin in the events history that left both men too exhausted
        to shake hands though soon after became life long friends. In his final
        Olympics in 1936 in the double sculls at the age of 37 he with partner
        Dick Southwood rowed down the German double in front of Adolf Hitler
        to take Gold in what he described as &ldquo;the sweetest race I ever
      rowed in&rdquo;.</p>
      <div class="imgRight"><img src="/history/1933BoomedCourseCrowd.jpg" alt="" /><br />

      <p>By the 1920s familiar clubs such as Molesey, Thames, Twickenham and
        London were racing, plus with less familiar clubs such as the London
        Joint Stock Bank RC and the Royal School of Mines. The trophies were,
        by then, pretty magnificent such as the Coronation Eights Challenge Cup
        for Thames Cup Eights. By 1925, The Duke and Duchess of York gave their
        patronage to the Regatta. The Regatta was still high on the social calendar
        in the 1930&rsquo;s as seen with the large crowds this time viewed from
        Raven&rsquo;s Ait looking towards Queen&rsquo;s Promenade with Kingston
      RC winning the Coronation Eights Challenge Cup in 1933.</p>
      <p><a href="#top">Back to top ^^ </a></p>
      <p>Another regular
        competitor in the 1930s was Dick Offer, a past President of Kingston
        RC and Chairman of the Regatta who sadly died in February this year.
        Dick was born into a family already living by the river in Kingston.
        His grandfather, Alfred Burgoine, was a boat builder who proudly produced
        one of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Royal Barges, and a motor launch that held
        the World Water Speed record. His affinity with the river was already
      in his genes. His family have paid this tribute to Dick:</p>
      <div class="imgLeft"><img src="/history/JackDick1936.jpg" alt="" /><br /> 
      Jack &amp; Dick Offer 1936</div>
      <p>&ldquo;Dick&rsquo;s
        formal introduction to rowing started at Tiffin School and afterwards
        at Kingston RC where he was to become a lifelong member. Competitive
        rowing became a constant factor in Dick&rsquo;s life and this drive took
        him to a Henley medal in 1936 (pairing with his brother Jack in the Silver
        Goblets (see photo of the Offer brothers) - then to Olympic trials and
        then in 1938 to selection for the British Empire Games in Sydney, where
      they won a silver medal. </p>
      <p>Within only a few months of his return, Dick
        and Mac were married on the day before war was declared. He gained his
        Commission in the Royal Navy and found himself on Convoy Escort duties.
        In the D-Day Normandy landings, by then a Commander of a Tank Landing
        Craft, it was Dick&rsquo;s responsibility, with accurate navigation,
        to be first to his allotted Arromanches Beach to land the Beachmaster
        and this he did with unerring competence. Dick was somewhat reluctant
        to reminisce about his war service, but he was clearly proud of the fact
        that after transferring a badly injured soldier to the hospital ship
        under enemy fire, he returned the ship and crew to British shores without
        further serious casualty, despite having hit a mine and with a live shell
      in the hull!</p>
      <div class="imgRight"><img src="/history/DickOffer2007.jpg" alt="Dick Offer 2007" /><br />

      <p>After hostilities ceased Dick was quick to return to Kingston
        RC, which saw him in many crews up to the 1950&rsquo;s. It was then that
        he found a new passion - that of coaching both at KRC and at Tiffin School.
        There are many who will have happy memories of him in that role, some
        even who have cause to thank him for the guidance he gave them to reach
        high rowing honours and international success. He was an inspirational
      teacher, drawing on his own water skills and watermanship.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Dick
        will be greatly missed by all those who knew him, but particularly by
        those at Kingston RC and those who assisted him with the running of the
      Regatta which he did for many years in different capacities.</p>
      <p>Kingston
        RC&rsquo;s current President Alan Spong, a slightly younger peer of Dick&rsquo;s,
        also competed in the Regatta shortly after the war and is kindly sponsoring
        an event at this year&rsquo;s Regatta. Alan paid this tribute to his
      love of rowing.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;My Father was responsible for installing in me
        my lasting love of the upriver part of the Thames and rowing. I was born
        soon after he had competed in &lsquo;The Doggetts Coat &amp; Badge&rsquo; race
        held annually in July since 1715 and from an early age taught me how
        to scull, buying me my first sculling boat when I was 12. Even now I
        can recall the pleasure from sculling along by myself through the various
        reaches of the Thames. Unfortunately the 1939-45 War interrupted those
        happy days but nonetheless I was fortunate to be still fit enough on
        my return to Civvy Street to start again. This time it was in fours and
        eights and continued to do so for the next 30 years. My best years started
        when I joined Kingston RC in 1951 and had the opportunity and good fortune
        to compete in regattas both up and down river, especially our own Kingston
        Regatta. But it was not only the competing, it was and still is the memories
        of friendships made, of races won and lost and just being involved in
        the sport. Finally, I wish to congratulate those persons, mostly Kingston
        RC Members, responsible for running the Kingston Amateur Regatta and
      wish them a successful 150th anniversary.&rdquo;</p>

J Tann, Tim Crooks Grandfather</div>
      <p>Going back for a moment
        to the crew of the Thames RC 4 of 1919 we find another regular competitor
        in J L Tann who won senior sculls in 1911 and the famous Wingfield Sculls
      in 1914.</p>
      <p>Some of you may be able to recognise the family resemblance
        in that Tann is the Grandfather of Kingston&rsquo;s very own Tim Crooks
        who won silver in the Montreal Olympics in 1976 and perhaps more famously
        won the 1977 BBC &lsquo;Superstars&rsquo; competition. Tim&rsquo;s love
      of rowing and determination is encapsulated in this tribute:</p>
      
<p>&ldquo;You
        set off for an outing. It can be cold, windy and rough, or maybe lovely
        sun, but it's a challenge to lift yourself to perform to your best for
        the conditions. You can be stiff, up-tight and tired but you&rsquo;re
        getting warmed up and the healing process has begun. <div class="imgRight"><img src="/history/TimCrooksDiamondScullsHenley1969.jpg" alt="Tim Crooks Diamond Sculls Henley 1969" /><br />
Tim Crooks in the Diamond Sculls<br/> at Henley  1969</div>
        <p>You&rsquo;re working
          to make the boat travel as far as possible between strokes. There's
          a magic moment when the stroke is released and the boat flies away
          as you relax, leaving the swirls in the water as the only evidence
          of the push that you train and train to exert. You've warmed up but
          you steel yourself to do the set training, and you're off. Quality,
          speed, it's hard, of course it's hard, conserve or you won't even finish
          the first one, but keep the boat speed, keep the hands quick, it's
          good, it's rough now, over the waves, keep pushing, tiring now, push
          on, keep it quick, don't let it go, push on, and it's finished. Only
      three more to go...</p>
        <p><a href="#top">Back to top ^^ </a></p>
        <p>It's
        always good, very satisfying. Just occasionally you have a bad outing,
        but either way, you did it, you feel better for it, so worth the effort.
      You always have to keep going &ndash; a bit like the Regatta.&rdquo;</p>
      <div class="imgLeft"><img src="/history/1920sRavensAit1921.jpg" alt="Cox P S Martin of Thames RC, seen left, being carried to his boat for the final of the Coronation Challenge Cup in 1921" /><br />
      Cox P S Martin<br/> of Thames RC</div>
      <p>As
        Tim so aptly describes, rowers have qualities of immense determination
        and no-one demonstrates these better than the disabled Cox P S Martin
        of Thames RC, seen  left, being carried to his boat for the final
      of the Coronation Challenge Cup in 1921.</p>
      <p>The Regatta moved from Raven&rsquo;s
        Ait in 1937 to Canbury Park Gardens after the Club moved to Turk&rsquo;s
        Boat House in Lower Ham Road. In the late 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s came
        the new generation often referred to as the &lsquo;MAD&rsquo; generation.
        Literary types probably know that MAD stands for &lsquo;Mutually Assured
        Destruction&rsquo; where the threat of nuclear annihilation by either
        of the super powers led to a generation who believed that life should
        be grabbed with both hands and lived to the full. In keeping with this
        approach was Colin Ellis aka &lsquo;The Vamp&rsquo; who was born in Scotland
        where his Father was serving in the armed forces shortly after the War
        but his family arrived in Kingston with the boy Vamp in 1963. The Vamp&rsquo;s
      family have penned this tribute to him and the Regatta:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;First
        joining Kingston RC in 1967and after representing England, Vamp then
        stroked Leander in 1970 to victory in the Thames Cup at Henley at just
        19. The following year he returned to Kingston RC narrowly losing to
        Harvard in the final in the same event. Vamp then took Kingston crews
        behind the Iron Curtain to compete with the Soviet block. Once arrested
        in East Germany wearing a kilt he pointed to his birthplace on his passport
        claiming he was the Baron of Dumbarton. Fearing a diplomatic incident
      he was soon released.</p>
      <p>After meeting Etuf Essen Ruder Club on his travels
        Vamp stroked them at Henley and when at the start the umpire asked if
        their opposition had any questions, loudly proclaimed &ldquo;ve are ze
        Germans and ve ask ze questions&rdquo;. Despite his travels and living
        in Holland for several years, Vamp was Kingston to the core. Sadly, in
        1999, on his final adventure, Vamp died on Namibia&rsquo;s Skeleton Coast.
        As Vamp approached races he often played &lsquo;The Ride of The Valkries&rsquo; to
        set the mood. His ashes were thus scattered on the river at Kingston
        to Wagner. Greatly missed but comforted that Vamp is embraced by the
      river and remembered in this special year.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>A peer of &lsquo;The
        Vamp&rsquo; is Steve Chasey who first rowed at the Regatta for Kingston
        Grammar School and has been a lifelong member of Kingston RC where he
        still coaches and with the greatest of respect to Steve can safely be
      described as being a member of the &lsquo;MAD&rsquo; crowd. Steve writes:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Without
        rowing I really don&rsquo;t know where I would be. It has been the constant
        that has held everything together. From schooldays in Kingston through
        the hedonistic 60s into the armed forces, special forces, whatever the
        world has brought, rowing and the river has always given me space to
        breathe again. To take those gasps of air after a heavy workout on the
        river as the mist rises to reveal a warming sun saying &lsquo;good morning&rsquo;,
        easing those aching muscles, giving fresh light on the world again. The
        river has been my life, so much so that I can&rsquo;t imagine life without
        it. I now live on a boat on the river at Kingston, a part of its ebb
        and flow. From competing at the Regatta as a boy to coaching crews I
        have been coming to the Regatta for 50 years now and I wouldn&rsquo;t
      miss this day for the world.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>But the river is not just for rowers,
        but is for all to enjoy, from fishermen, sailors, to pleasure craft users
        and as Ratty so eloquently put it to Mole &ldquo;There is nothing&mdash;absolutely
        nothing&mdash;half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.
        In or out of &lsquo;em, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Nothing seems really
        to matter, that&rsquo;s the charm of it. Whether you get away, or whether
        you don&rsquo;t; whether you arrive at your destination or whether you
        reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at all, you&rsquo;re
        always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and when you&rsquo;ve
      done it there&rsquo;s always something else to do.&quot;</p>
      <p>One of our
        regular attendees and former rower at St Edward&rsquo;s School is A D
        Wall who is also sponsoring an event and his son pays tribute to his
      Father for showing him the joys of the river:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;From a young age
        I was aware of my Father&rsquo;s love for the river. He used to tell
        me about his rowing at school, fishing and boating holidays as a boy.
        It was by Kingston&rsquo;s old power station that he first took me angling.
        I don&rsquo;t remember actually catching anything but I do remember him
        getting very animated when an eight glided past. When I was older we
        would often hire a cabin cruiser for the weekend. It was on these trips
        that I discovered that until you have been on the river you can&rsquo;t
        really appreciate it - a parallel world, everything familiar but viewed
        from a different perspective. From hiring the occasional cruiser my Father
        went to owning one of the old hire boats but this year my Father and
        I are now partners in a new boat. It&rsquo;s a new chapter in our river
        story, one that I know will continue for many years. I cannot think of
        anything better than to share my love of the river with the Regatta and
        the celebration of their 150th anniversary. Thank you Dad and thank you
        Kingston Regatta for bringing the river to life to so many people over
      the years.&rdquo;</p>
  <div class="imgLeft"><img src="/history/KieranWestAtSydney.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="201" /><br />
      Kieran West at <br/> Sydney 2000 </div>
      <p>The Regatta moved to its current site opposite the
        town centre in 1991 and to bring us almost up to date we can&rsquo;t
        let this opportunity go past without celebrating our other local Olympians.
        Firstly, Kieran West, who won Gold in Sydney in 2000, first plied his
        rowing skills as a young boy at Kingston Regatta in the early 1990s.
        Despite his commitments with the GB squad and Cambridge University with
        whom he won this year&rsquo;s Boat Race, Kieran still found time to support
        the Guy Salmon Dry Rowing Challenge Cup last year by providing a coaching
        lesson at Kingston RC and sharing his Gold medal with youngsters from
      local schools.</p>
     
   <p>Kieran has kindly provided his own river tribute:</p>
      <p>&quot;As
        a school boy I used to cycle to Kingston RC whenever I could to get out
        on the river and row. As my school didn&rsquo;t have rowing as an option
        at that time the Club gave me a chance to give it a go and Kingston Regatta
        was one of my first chances to compete. Make no mistake, rowing is a
        tough sport &ndash; you need to be dedicated, determined and have a never-say-die
        attitude &ndash; but it teaches you a few things about yourself in the
        process and rowing has provided me and countless others with those qualities
        to take through life. If you really believe in yourself and prepared
        to work its amazing what you can achieve, and if you are lucky enough
        to test those qualities to the limit and come through, there is no feeling
        like it. Nothing can describe the sheer joy of winning gold at the Sydney
      Olympics in the GB eight. </p>
      <p><a href="#top">Back to top ^^ </a></p>
      <div class="imgRight"><img src="/history/GB8Sydney.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="166" /><br />
      GB 8 at Sydney 2000 </div>
      <p>I hope that all of this year&rsquo;s competitors,
        young and old, will step up to the challenge, to compete fairly, honestly,
        to give your best, to be gracious in defeat and modest in victory, and
        always enjoy it and remember to thank those that make this happen, the
        volunteers of Kingston Regatta &ndash; the true champions who have given
      me and others the chance to excel. Have a great day.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Our final
        river story comes from one of the great Olympians of our time &ndash; James
        Cracknell who first started rowing at Kingston as a schoolboy at Kingston
      Grammar School. James fondly recalls his days rowing at Kingston:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I
        remember standing near the boundary rope kicking my heels during another
        cricket match when I heard a strange noise coming from the river behind
        me. A rhythmical thudding and the sound of something slicing through
        the water, I turned round to see a men&rsquo;s eight pounding up river.
        I lost interest in the cricket match that second. I was lucky enough
        to go to Kingston Grammar School and rowing was an option, so I signed
        up. What a place to learn to row, I didn&rsquo;t realise how lucky I
        was to spend the first five years of my rowing life on this stretch of
        water. The scenery is amazing, the beautiful backdrop of Hampton Court
        Palace at one end and the run through the town at the other &ndash; which
        was always more eventful in the summer when the riverside pubs were packed
        in the evening. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to row on lakes and
        rivers all over the world but very few have bettered the experience of
        Kingston, to have an uninterrupted 8km stretch of water is immense although
        one end to the other felt like the other side of the earth when I was
        14 but as I got older not having to turn round all the time was a luxury.
        It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, you have to deal with boats of tourists looking
        at Hampton Court whilst drowning you in their wash and kayakers who always
        go on the wrong side of the river &ndash; then again that was good practice
        for the Olympics as they go on the wrong side of the course there as
        well! &ndash; I would like to take this opportunity to wish everybody
      at the Regatta an enjoyable day.&rdquo;</p>
      <div class="imgLeft"><img src="/history/JamesCracknell.jpg" alt="James Cracknell" width="150" height="225" /><br />
      James Cracknell      </div>
      <p>We hope that Kieran, James and
        all our contributors together with Kingston Regatta will provide inspiration
        to another generation of river users who will learn to appreciate the
        joy of an outdoor activity with a growing understanding and respect of
        their environment. The river at Kingston has and will continue to bring
        pleasure to the people of Kingston and those that visit the town whether
        they are taking a river boat cruise to Hampton Court, or come to the
        river to fish, sail, canoe or as in the case of our Regatta to row. What
        is clear though by the river stories, which is embodied by the picture
        of James and his son, is that we pass on our passion to the next generation
        who soon realise that the river is a great place to spend some time.
        This is how the Regatta has kept going from generation to generation
        and it is the people who have made the river at Kingston such a special
        place over the 150 years that we owe a debt to. We hope that every competitor
        and spectator will reflect for a moment their contribution and celebrate
        the occasion with us. </p>
