<div id="recreational">
    <ol>
		<li>Recreational rowing events will be raced over 1000 metres, with no repechages.</li>  
		<li>All races will be raced in stable boats, and all boats and blades will be provided.</li> 
		<li>All boating will take place from the Kingston Rowing Club landing stage.</li>
		<li>Competitors need to have pushed off from the landing stage at least 30 minutes before the time 
            scheduled for their event, as they will be rowing two miles upstream to get to the start.</li>                           
		<li>Crews should follow the navigational instructions for the regatta as they head upstream to the start.</li>
        <li>Competitors should be those who are not training for open BR competition.</li>
        <li> Ideally crews should be mixed crews (excluding coxes) of two men and two women. While we do not want to exclude any crew combination, we may introduce some time advantage at the start to reflect differential combinations.</li>                   
		<li>The Recreational Novice 4x+ event is open to competitors who started rowing after 1st January 2023. It is not possible for us to monitor this so we are relying on the goodwill of relevant clubs to ensure that they comply with the intended spirit of this regulation.</li>
