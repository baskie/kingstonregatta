<p align=justify>The organising committee of the Kingston Amateur Regatta (KAR) believes that the welfare and wellbeing of all children is paramount. All children, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, religion or ability have equal rights to safety and protection. All suspicions, concerns and allegations of harm will be taken seriously and responded to swiftly and responsibly.</p>
          <h3>Policy</h3>
          <ol>
            <li> Children and young people<sup>(1)</sup> competing at Kingston Amateur
              and Kingston Borough Regattas (KAR and KBR) can expect to participate in a safe and enjoyable environment.</li>
            <li>The regattas
              comply with the British Rowing (BR)
              policy on child protection, &ldquo;Safeguarding and Protecting 
			Children Policy.&rdquo;<sup>(2)</sup>
              Competing clubs and schools are required, by BR
              rules, to be affiliated to the BR and are also required
              to comply with this policy.</li>
            <li>Club
              or school coaches, teachers or junior co-ordinators
              are responsible for the safety and welfare of their
              junior competitors at all times and they, or a designated
              substitute are expected to be available at the regatta
              while their crews are present.</li>
            <li>KAR and KBR officials, sponsors, volunteers,
              staff employed by service providers, e.g. catering,
              and the press and publicity agencies, do not generally
              have direct contact with, nor authority over, children.&nbsp; However,
              each will be informed of their responsibility for
              vigilance and to report inappropriate behaviour</li>
            <li>Anyone
              observing apparent child abuse or inappropriate behaviour
              should report it to Race Control who will immediately
              inform the Regattas' Welfare Officer who will respond
              to the matter according to the BR policy<sup>(2)</sup>. This policy is incorporated in the
              regatta regulations and will be publicised at the
              regattas.</li>
            <li>The Regatta committee carries out a thorough risk assessment 
			each year and BR vets its procedures and regulations.
              This ensures as far as realistically possible that
              the safety of juniors is assured.</li>
            <li>Once
              on the water, all rowers are subject to the regatta&rsquo;s
              water safety rules and to the BR Rules of Racing
              which are implemented by BR qualified umpires.</li>
          </ol>
