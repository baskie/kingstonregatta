<h3>Intent</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The organising committee of the Kingston Amateur Regatta (KAR) believes that the welfare and wellbeing of all children is paramount. All children, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, religion or ability have equal rights to safety and protection. All suspicions, concerns and allegations of harm will be taken seriously and responded to swiftly and responsibly.</li>
  </ol>
<h3>Policy</h3>
  <ol start="2">
    <li> Children and young people competing at Kingston Amateur
         and Kingston Borough Regattas (KAR and KBR) can expect to participate in a safe and enjoyable environment. Anyone under the age of 18 is considered to be a child/young person.</li>
    <li>The regattas comply with the, British Rowing (BR) 
        <a href="https://www.britishrowing.org/sites/default/files/pages/22685/SPCG%20Policy%20Feb%202013.pdf">Safeguarding and Protecting Children Policy</a>.<br>
        Competing clubs and schools are required, by BR
        rules, to be affiliated to the BR and are also required
        to comply with this policy.</li>
    <li>Club
        or school coaches, teachers or junior co-ordinators
        are responsible for the safety and welfare of their
        junior competitors at all times and they, or a designated
        substitute are expected to be available at the regatta
        while their crews are present.</li>
    <li>KAR and KBR officials, sponsors, volunteers,
        staff employed by service providers, e.g. catering,
        and the press and publicity agencies, do not generally
        have direct contact with, nor authority over, children.&nbsp; However,
        each will be informed of their responsibility for
        vigilance and to report inappropriate behaviour</li>
    <li>Anyone observing apparent child abuse or inappropriate behaviour
        should report it to Race Control who will immediately
        inform the Regattas' Welfare Officer who will respond
        to the matter according to the BR <a href="https://www.britishrowing.org/sites/default/files/pages/22685/SPCG%20Policy%20Feb%202013.pdf">policy</a>. This policy is incorporated in the regatta regulations and will be publicised at the
        regattas.</li>
    <li>The Regatta committee carries out a thorough risk assessment 
			  each year and BR vets its procedures and regulations.
        This ensures as far as realistically possible that
        the safety of juniors is assured.</li>
    <li>Once on the water, all rowers are subject to the regatta&rsquo;s
        water safety rules and to the BR Rules of Racing
        which are implemented by BR qualified umpires.</li>
