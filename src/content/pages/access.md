<p>You are advised to approach from Teddington. Kingston town centre will be crowded and slow.</p>
<p>Be aware of the Hampton Court Flower Show which usually coincides with the regatta and will cause congestion and delays in that area and the approaches from Sunbury and Esher.</p>
<p>The trailer field will be open from 7am to 6.30pm on the Friday before the regatta and until noon on the Monday after the regatta.</p>
