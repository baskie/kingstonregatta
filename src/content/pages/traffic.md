          <li>The above map, which is not to scale, identifies five locations/areas where drivers arriving at the regatta may need guidance or help. As vehicles arrive at the points the map identifies, the drivers will be directed and controlled for their safety and that of the public. The vehicles and drivers will be subject to control which may include guidance and help as detailed.</li>
          <li>Marshals will wear Hi-Vis tops to clearly identify them as traffic Marshals for the event.</li>
		  <li>Directional signage from the Hampton Wick roundabout to the Barge Walk will be produced to cover such information as where the car park is, the No Entry, the Exit, cautions for cyclists and pedestrians plus Stop and Go boards where appropriate.</li>
		  <li>A small area of the car park nearest to the regatta entrance will be prioritised for disabled parking.</li>
		  <li>In the event where an Emergency vehicle requires access, the control points will be used to maintain clear access routes.</li>
		  <li>The small volume of contractor&#8217;s vehicles that visit the site on the Friday prior to the Regatta and the Monday after the regatta will be met and directed by the regatta&#8217;s &#8220;land crew&#8221;.
