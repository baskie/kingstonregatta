  <h3>Racing</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The Regattas will be held in accordance with the British Rowing <a href="https://www.britishrowing.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Rules-of-Racing-2016-Final.pdf" target="new">Rules of Racing</a> and
			<a href="https://www.britishrowing.org/upload/files/RowSafe/Complete-v1.pdf" target="new">Row Safe Guide</a>. Boats must also carry an Environment Agency registration plate to row on  the Upper Thames, and display the British Rowing Identification. This consists of the three-letter club code followed by the three-digit fleet number (including zeros). All boats taking part in this event have to be licensed, either in advance through the EA/British Rowing Block Scheme, or through purchase of a day license directly from the EA. Ensure you allow sufficient time for purchase of your boat license.</li>
          <li>The Regattas will  be rowed three abreast, downstream towards Kingston Bridge. Junior 14 2x and 1x and all younger events will be raced two abreast.</li>
          <li>The Amateur  Regatta will be raced over 1,000 metres from stake boats. The Borough Regatta will  be raced over 500 metres with a free start.</li>
		  <li>Mixed-sex crews must have at least 50% female competitors.</li>
		  <li>In the event of changes in the river conditions, the Race Committee may change the degree of stagger at the finish. If this happens an announcement will be made.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Events and Entrance Fees</h3>
        <ol start="6">
          <li>The Regatta  Committee reserves the right to withdraw an event and refund the entry fee, if there are insufficient entries. Entries will be divided into events based on ranking points. The committee reserves the right to exclude from events those entries with particularly low or particularly high ranking points. In the event of over-subscription to an event, priority will be given to early entries that have fully paid the entry fee. Please indicate on <a href="https://broe2.britishrowing.org/" target="new">BROE2</a> if you do NOT want an entry to be raised to a higher status or age-group.</li>
          <li>The Borough  Regatta committee will endeavour to accommodate crews whose status has changed  as a result of a win at the Amateur regatta.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If this is not possible, entry fees will be returned.</li>
          <li>The entrance fee is &pound;18 per seat, except the <a href="/sprint-eights/">Jubilee Sprints</a>:<br>
