<h3>Safety on the water</h3>
<p align="justify">Although there is in force an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kingston-amateur-regatta-2021-river-restriction-notice/kingston-amateur-regatta-2021-river-restriction-notice" target="new">EA notice</a>, restricting access to the regatta course by general traffic, the river is <strong>not</strong> closed to other river users. Please therefore read these instructions  in conjunction with the <a href="/circulation/">map</a> of the course showing the required circulation pattern.</p>
        <p><strong>Keep Right (starboard, to bow side) at all times</strong> when navigating and observe the following rules:-</p>
        <h5>Boating from the Landing Stages</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Place boats in the water <strong>bows upstream,</strong> and proceed directly upstream.</li>
          <li>Cross the course between races and cutting off the corner of the course, passing upstream of the first large buoy and between the small course markers, observing instructions from the circulation marshal.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Paddling to the start / warm-up</h5>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>Follow the starboard-hand rule and stay close to the course marker buoys in the navigation channel</li>
          <li><strong>Do Not Stop</strong> <strong>or do practice starts </strong>in the navigation channel </li>
          <li>Proceed to the marshalling area above Raven&rsquo;s Ait and above the start for warming-up</li>
          <li>Do any practice starts <strong>upstream of</strong> Raven&rsquo;s Ait </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>At the Finish </h5>
        <ol start="7">
          <li>Continue through the finish as soon as you are able</li>
          <li>Pass downstream through the centre arch of the bridge and turn below the bridge, returning upstream through the Middlesex (regatta enclosure) side arch to approach the landing stages. </li>
			<li>If there is observed to be the possibility of a large motor vessel heading for the centre arch, please use an alternative arch of the bridge, as advised by the circulation marshal.</li>
			<li>At all times observe the instructions of your race umpire and the circulation marshal.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Siren Codes </h5>
        <ol start="11">
	        <li><strong>The following Siren Codes are used by the large  passenger cruisers:</strong><br>
	          These passenger cruisers will  be plying from the Surrey bank in the narrow part of the navigation channel and  must be given right of way</p>
